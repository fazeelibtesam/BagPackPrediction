# Kaggle Playground Series – Model Ranking Competition

## 🏁 Overview

This repository documents my participation in the **Kaggle Playground Series – Model Ranking** competition. I joined this competition primarily to **test my knowledge**, **sharpen my machine learning skills**, and most importantly, to **have fun** while experimenting with different modeling approaches.

## 🎯 Goal

The objective of the competition was to build a model that accurately ranks inputs according to given criteria. It served as a great opportunity to explore a practical ML problem in a low-stakes, learning-friendly environment.

## 📈 Result

I ranked **#2956** on the final leaderboard.

While this wasn’t a top-ranking result, the competition gave me valuable hands-on experience with:
- Data preprocessing
- Model selection and tuning
- Evaluation metrics for ranking problems
- Experimentation and iteration strategies

## 💡 Why I Participated

- To challenge myself with a real-world-style ML problem.
- To explore new libraries, tools, and techniques.
- To enjoy the process of building and refining models in a competitive setting.

## 🔧 Tech Stack

- Python
- scikit-learn / XGBoost / LightGBM
- pandas / NumPy / matplotlib / seaborn
- Jupyter Notebooks

## 📂 Contents

This repo may include (depending on what you’ve added):
- Notebooks with my experiments and approach
- Scripts for data preprocessing and model training
- Notes and observations from the competition
